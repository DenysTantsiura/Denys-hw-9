'''Task 9
Bot. A console bot helper that will recognize commands entered 
from the keyboard and respond accordingly.
The bot accepts commands:
"hello", replies to the console "How can I help you?"
"add ...". With this command, the bot saves a new contact in memory (in the dictionary, for example). Instead of ... the user enters the name and phone number, necessarily with a space.
"change ..." With this command, the bot stores the new phone number of the existing contact in memory. Instead of ... the user enters the name and phone number, necessarily with a space.
"phone ...." With this command, the bot outputs the phone number for the specified contact to the console. Instead of ... the user enters the name of the contact whose number should be displayed.
"show all". With this command, the bot outputs all saved contacts with phone numbers to the console.
"good bye", "close", "exit" by any of these commands, the bot ends its work after outputting "Good bye!" to the console.'''
